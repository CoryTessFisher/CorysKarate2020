  <span class="subtitle">Background of Karate Shin-Toshi<br>
  </span></p>
<p>The Chinese/Japanese word shin can be translated several ways, &quot;new way&quot; or &quot;new form&quot; are two examples. The word toshi was derived from the old English word &quot;tosher,&quot; which means &quot;unaffiliated with any other style.&quot;</p>
<p>The Shin-Toshi emblem (created before the name) consists of two hands surrounded by olive branches: one being closed into a fist--representing the straight-line &quot;hard&quot; martial arts--and the other open, symbolizing the soft, fluid styles. The olive branches are a universal symbol of peace and harmony. The yin and yang between the olive branches represents the harmony in nature between opposing forces exemplifying the seemingly &quot;opposing&quot; styles which compose Shin-Toshi. The Chinese characters surrounding the branches are kara-te-shin, and the phonetic representation of toshi.</p>
<p>Mickey Fisher, founder of Karate Shin-Toshi, felt that &ldquo;there is actually no excuse for shunning all techniques from other styles and/or believing that one's own art is superior in every aspect to all others. Such a philosophy is both unfair and ignorant and is in fact not as &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; as some may believe. The Shaolin monks, forefathers of many present day Asian martial arts, were continually willing to accept new techniques and philosophies which might benefit them. It was only because of people's prejudice and ignorance that an unwillingness to recognize other ways developed in the martial arts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shin-Toshi techniques include the strong kicks of Korea, the rapid and exacting movements of Japan, and the fluidity of Chinese styles. A typical Shin-Toshi technique is a powerful side kick which utilizes full extension of the hip and strikes with the heel, yet does not waste excess time and motion on the fold. Snapping backfists and swift front and spinning kicks give the style its share of Japanese influence. Evasive circular blocks and graceful crane stances are also part of the style.</p>
<p>Belt ranks in Shin-Toshi range from white, gold, green, blue, brown, and finally black belt as in some other styles. The length of time required to earn a shodan in Shin-Toshi range from 3-5 years, slightly longer than for most other styles. Much work is expected from students for each belt rank and examinations are extremely demanding, in order to be promoted, the student must have sufficiently mastered progressively more advanced techniques, fighting and katas. Martial arts philosophy becomes more important in advanced belts, and continuity of mind and body begins to appear in techniques and forms. Hyung (patterns) is an especially interesting part of shin-toshi, because it puts the technique and spirit of the style into living motion.</p>
<p>The repertoire of Shin-Toshi kata today includes the system's original forms, plus traditional kata from Korean, Japanese, Chinese and Okinawan systems. The four initial hyung all H-shaped and are named tai-guk chodan through sahdan (1-4). Following are advanced kata which are called Pyungons and are five in number. Advanced students are introduced to traditional forms from other systems, including Basai, a kata which is taught in both Japanese and Korean styles, and Choolgi, the &quot;Iron Horse&quot; hyung of Tae Kwon Do, The ancient Kusan-Kudai , or &quot;Moon Form,&quot; and the relatively modern Choog Mu (developed by Jhoon Rhee) are also taught.</p>
