    <!-- START TESTIMONIAL 1 --> 
   I just can&rsquo;t even thank you enough!!! For all of your support and encouragement and influence. This kid has given us a run for our money, and I am truly grateful you are part of his &ldquo;village&rdquo; of good people helping and encouraging and motivating him. We couldn&rsquo;t do it alone. What a tremendous blessing these past few years in karate with you have been. I am so thankful we found you! Thank you a million times over!  ~ T. Bauer<br>
   </p>
<p>I was just reflecting today on what a blessing karate has been for my boys, in particular your leadership. You are as outstanding of a teacher as I have ever known. Richie is more passionate about karate than anything else in his life. It has given him drive and goals. It has stretched him in great ways. You have been a significant part of developing the man he is becoming. And for that, I will be eternally grateful. I can't put in words how grateful I am for your kindness, patience, leadership, and guidance. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. ~ R. Hoopes<br>
    <br>
      I just wanted to let you know how much I've loved having Jordan in karate. He has had a great experience and we've enjoyed watching his growth and development because of your training--not only physically, but mentally and socially. It's a big deal to us, and we have appreciated your individualized attention. ~ J. Freeman<br>
</p>

I was talking with (my daughter) yesterday about her experience with your studio.  She and I both look fondly on all that she was able to accomplish with you. It was a very difficult time for our family when they were learning karate.  It was so good for them.  It's too bad that the lock-down and then our move prevented more training, but I want you to know that I, as a parent, am very thankful for all that you did for my children, especially my Ladies. God bless you and all at Cory's Karate!! ~J. Siebach
