<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="20" border="0" width="550"  align="left" class="contentwidth"><tr>
  <td align="left" valign="top" class="just"><strong class="subtitle">What?</strong> Traditionally, there were no ranks between white 
  belt and
  black belt. The student trained under the master for years, and
  when the master felt the student was trained sufficiently, he
  was granted the rank of Black Belt. In the Tan Ren Do Karate system,
  we have ten ranks which are earned between white belt and
  Black Belt to help motivate and to provide feedback while
  training.
    <p> <strong class="subtitle">When?</strong> Rank advancement and testing will vary depending 
  upon the progress of the students. Most beginning students test every 
  2 to 4 months&ndash;however, this may vary for each individual student. Testing 
  will be done in a group setting (with those other students who are prepared 
  to advance) and will be announced in class a few weeks before the actual 
  date. Students who are ready to test will be given a testing form at 
  that time.</p>
<p> <strong class="subtitle">Why?</strong> Testing and achieving rank advancements allows 
  the students to demonstrate what they have learned and feel a justifiable 
  pride in their accomplishments. In addition, an essential part of martial 
  arts training is learning mental and physical focus. For the majority 
  of students, testing for rank is a somewhat stressful experience. Yet, 
  testing is done in a safe environment that helps the students learn 
  to face and cope with this stress and anxiety.</p>
<p> <strong class="subtitle">How?</strong> Evaluation for readiness to test for rank advancement 
  is done by your instructor. If you feel you are ready to test for rank 
  advancement and have not been invited to do so by your instructor, talk 
  to her about it. Find out if it is just an oversight or if there are 
  specific things you need to work on.</p>
<p> If you have been invited to test it is very likely that you will 
  pass, or perhaps pass with specific areas of probation to correct. If you fail the test for some reason,  we will work together and you would be expected to be prepared to test at the next test.</p>
<p> <strong class="subtitle">Cost?</strong> There is a moderate testing fee associated 
  with testing for rank advancement. This fee is related to the rank of 
  the student testing and includes a belt, certificate, and weapon (if applicable) for next rank.</p>
<p> <strong class="subtitle">Expectations?</strong> A frequent question from students is 
  &ldquo;When can I test for rank?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Am I ready?&rdquo;. The essential key to 
  advancement in rank is performance improvement. Students do not enter 
  the studio with equal abilities. Some students find balance, coordination, 
  and memorization of the forms very challenging. Others don&rsquo;t. In the 
  beginning ranks, we take into serious consideration the natural abilities 
  of the students, and expect to see effort and improvement. Advancement 
  in rank should not be viewed as a race with other students, but as a 
  personal challenge.<br>
