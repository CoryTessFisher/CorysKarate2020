<div align="center">What It Means to be a Sensei<br>
  Written by Aleksandr Spackman<br>
  
  <br>
  
</div>
<hr class="page-splits">
<p>In Tan Ren Do Karate, the title of Sensei is earned upon the advancement to brown belt. It introduces new responsibility and opportunity, but what does it really mean? Webster defines Sensei as “a teacher or instructor”. The Chinese and Japanese word directly translates to “one who comes before”. I think that is a much better definition of what a Sensei really is.	</p>
<p>In martial arts, and throughout our lives, we are constantly learning. Not all knowledge is gained from someone older than us, or smarter, or wiser, or stronger. We learn primarily by watching other people and following their example. To learn something new, you must simply watch someone who “came before” you (in terms of that knowledge or skill), and you can benefit. As a Sensei, this has special significance. Others will be watching you constantly, and they will try to be like you. In a world that has so few positive role models, it is our duty to show everyone, both young and old, how to improve themselves and how to share that with others. At the same time, a true Sensei will learn from their pupil, discovering new things they had never even thought of before.  </p>
<p>For me, it has been helpful to assume that I can learn something from anyone and everyone. I look at other people, not to compare myself with them, but to find ways to strengthen myself and improve my mind, body, and spirit in every way possible. When I teach the Junior Dragons, I look for ways to be more fun and caring, when I teach higher ranks, I look for ways to be stronger and more precise. When I teach a lesson at church, I look for ways to improve my spiritual well-being. A true Sensei will always be learning from those who came before them, even during more mundane activities.  </p>
<p>Contrary to martial arts action movies, a Sensei’s daily life is usually just like the average Joe’s. But if one were to examine their behavior more closely, they would see that a Sensei doesn’t just gather knowledge whenever possible, they also share it. A Sensei’s job is only half done when they have become as wise and intelligent as a human possibly can. A real Sensei will teach their wisdom to all that come after them. They teach to benefit the learner, so in time, the student will become the teacher. A Sensei will always serve everyone they meet. They will help everyone less fortunate, and there is more to fortune than money and power. Even the richest, most powerful ruler would have much to gain from a true Sensei. A Sensei never gets discouraged because their teachings don’t seem to take root. They understand these things take time. Perhaps the greatest skill a Sensei has is patience.  </p>
<p>The most glorious thing a Sensei will ever feel is the light coming off a student’s face when they finally “get it”. This is a feeling a true Sensei cherishes, and remembers forever, even if they become too old and fragile to do martial arts. Wisdom and skill are passed down even as new Sensei take the reigns. Karate is only the first step. A Sensei knows their knowledge will be valued as long as there is another to teach it. The future will always remember the one who came before.
